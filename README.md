my blog.

here i learn new stuff and write about it. and other things.

right now i am using [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to push this site to a [github page](http://pages.github.com/). so it´s static. on the reader´s side.

later i will need more dynamic stuff, so i will probably switch to a self built ruby on rails solution.

but i´m still learning.
