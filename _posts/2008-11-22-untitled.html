<blockquote><blockquote>
An authentic vampire-killing kit from the 1800’s recently sold at auction for nearly $15,000 to a pale man in a black cape. “This is a complete kit that comes fully equipped - stakes, mirrors, a gun with silver bullets (because where there are Vampires there might be Werewolves), crosses, a Bible, holy water, candles and garlic.” The whole kit is housed in a beautifully decorated American walnut carrying-case.
