<h3>Pure Nerd</h3>

<p>52 % Nerd, 34% Geek, 26% Dork</p>

<p>For The Record:</p>

<p>A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia.<br />
A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often an obscure or difficult one.<br />
A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social expectations/interactions.</p>

<p>You scored better than half in Nerd, earning you the title of: <em>Pure Nerd</em>.</p>

<p>The times, they are a-changing. It used to be that being exceptionally smart led to being unpopular, which would ultimately lead to picking up all of the traits and tendences associated with the &#8220;dork.&#8221; No-longer. Being smart isn&#8217;t as socially crippling as it once was, and even more so as you get older: eventually being a Pure Nerd will likely be replaced with the following label: Purely Successful.</p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>
