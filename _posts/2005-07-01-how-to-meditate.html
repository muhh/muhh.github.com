<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;The most important thing is practice in daily life; then you can know gradually the true value of religion. Doctrine is not meant for mere knowledge, but for the improvement of our minds. In order to do that, it must be part of our life. If you put religious doctrine in a building and when you leave the building depart from the practices, you cannot gain its value.&#8221;<br />
  His Holiness the Dalai Lama, from &#8216;The Dalai Lama, A Policy of Kindness&#8217;</p>
