> “The most important thing is practice in daily life; then you can know
> gradually the true value of religion. Doctrine is not meant for mere
> knowledge, but for the improvement of our minds. In order to do that,
> it must be part of our life. If you put religious doctrine in a
> building and when you leave the building depart from the practices,
> you cannot gain its value.” – His Holiness the Dalai Lama, from ‘The Dalai Lama, A Policy of
> Kindness’
