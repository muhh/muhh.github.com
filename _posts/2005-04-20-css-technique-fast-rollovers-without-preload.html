title: "CSS Technique: Fast Rollovers Without Preload"

<blockquote>
  <p>When using CSS image rollovers, two, three, or more images must be loaded (and often be preloaded for best results). We&#8217;ve got one image for each state (normal, hover, active, visited etc). <strong>Putting all states into one image makes dynamic changes faster and requires no preload.</strong></p>
