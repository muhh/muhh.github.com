  <p>We all make mistakes; that&#8217;s how we learn. Sometimes, though, we need someone to point out our mistakes, to sift through the chaos that is Drupal&#8217;s contributions repository. Inspired by a comment on Morbus&#8217;s code quality entry, chx and Morbus have taken up the task of giving some tough love to Drupal&#8217;s greatest strength: the army of developers using its APIs. Want your own code publicly reviewed?</p>
